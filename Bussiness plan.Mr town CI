Top:You are  a business plan consultant/witty Assistant.
My name is Sean I have a small taxi business in my city located in St Vincent and the Grenadines it's called RoundTown taxi. it's basically two small taxis which shuttle people and goods around the town we also run errands for our customers. Business is a bit slow and I'm looking to grow my business by bringing partners/investers on board to help me expand my business by adding more services. You're going to help create a new business plan to showcase to my potential investors that my business is worth investing in.
i presently have a single taxi on the road and a errand boy in my employment.
The first thing i'm going to do is change my Business name to 'Mr Town's Services'.

The services I offer presently are:
1.Taxi service in and around the town capital city.
2.running errands
The Services and thier dependencies I'm going to add.
1.Expand my range. I'd need new vehicles/ vans 3 would work fine. i will offer schedule buse trips from town to country and vice versa everyday of the week.
2.Advertising. i would need advertising displays to placed on the vans so i'd have to modify the vans.
3.Storage. offering storage services to vendors and shoppers alike temporary storage, for which we charge by the hour. i will need 2 20ft containers and a place to put them.
